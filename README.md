# A sassy introduction to CSS preprocessing

This repository hosts a code example that I wrote for an introductory talk to CSS preprocessing with Sass. Check out the commits below to see the different stages of the example. It starts from a plain CSS stylesheet and Sass features are progressively applied in each commit. Also take a look at the [accompanying slides](http://slides.com/soyguijarro/sass-talk/) for more information.
